# NASA Sky Data Prototype

Prototype utilities for building an ESASky-like explorer backed exclusively by public NASA archives. The initial focus is on downloading survey cutouts and generating quick-look imagery from NASA's **SkyView** service, which federates data from multiple missions (DSS, GALEX, WISE, 2MASS, Fermi, ROSAT, etc.).

## üöÄ Goals

- Help you discover NASA-managed astronomical data that can power a visual explorer.
- Provide a reproducible script that fetches science-ready survey tiles and converts them into PNG previews.
- Document next steps for evolving the prototype into a richer web or desktop application.

## üì° Key NASA Data Sources

| Archive | What you get | Programmatic access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [NASA SkyView](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/titlepage.pl) | On-the-fly projection of surveys (optical, IR, UV, X-ray, gamma) | HTTP service + [`astroquery.skyview`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/skyview/skyview.html) |
| [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) | HST, JWST, Kepler/K2, TESS, GALEX, etc. | [`astroquery.mast`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html) APIs |
| [High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive.html) | Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, Fermi, ROSAT, etc. | [`astroquery.heasarc`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/heasarc/heasarc.html), TAP |
| [Planetary Data System (PDS)](https://pds.nasa.gov/) | Planetary mission data (images, spectra, telemetry) | [PDS Imaging Node APIs](https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/help/), [PDS Search](https://pds.nasa.gov/services/search/) |
| [NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/) | WISE/NEOWISE, Spitzer, 2MASS, Planck, etc. | [`astroquery.irsa`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/irsa/irsa.html), VO TAP |
| [NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/) | Curated datasets across NASA centers | REST API + CSV/JSON exports |

> Some APIs (e.g. MAST, NASA Open APIs) require a free API key or authentication token. The SkyView service used in this prototype is fully open and anonymous.

## üß≠ Prototype walkthrough

### 1. Create an isolated environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Fetch a survey cutout and generate a PNG

The CLI accepts either a resolvable object name or explicit coordinates. A DSS2 Red cutout of the Whirlpool Galaxy at 0.4¬∞ scale can be generated with:

```bash
python -m src.skyview_downloader --target "M51" --survey "DSS2 Red" --width 0.4 --pixels 800
```

To target custom celestial coordinates in decimal degrees:

```bash
python -m src.skyview_downloader --ra 201.3651 --dec -43.0191 --survey "WISE 3.4" --width 1.0 --pixels 1024
```

Outputs are written to `outputs/`:

- `<target>-<survey>.fits` ‚Äî the raw FITS cutout.
- `<target>-<survey>.png` ‚Äî contrast-stretched preview (Astropy WCS axes, grayscale colormap).

### 3. Spin up the interactive globe prototype

Launch the FastAPI service, which proxies NASA's SkyView service and serves the front-end assets:

```bash
uvicorn src.server:app --reload
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/app> in your browser. Rotate the sphere with your mouse or trackpad, use the zoom buttons to adjust the field of view, and switch between surveys (DSS, WISE, GALEX, Fermi). Every interaction requests a fresh cutout from NASA SkyView, so you're always looking at live archival imagery.

> The backend stores PNG tiles in `outputs/` to avoid re-downloading frequently requested fields.

### 4. Inspect available surveys

NASA maintains the full survey catalogue at <https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/survey.pl>. Any entry in the "Survey" column is compatible with the `--survey` option.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Continuous deployment on AWS EC2 (native runtime)

Every push to `main` now syncs the repository to an EC2 instance and restarts a systemd-managed uvicorn process‚Äîno containers required.

### 1. Prepare the EC2 host (one-time)

1. Launch an EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04+ or Amazon Linux 2023) with inbound access to TCP 80 (or front it with an ALB/NGINX if you prefer TLS on 443).
2. Install system packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip git
   # Amazon Linux: sudo dnf install -y python3 python3-venv git
   ```

3. Create a deployment directory and give your SSH user ownership:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/nasa-skyview/outputs
   sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/nasa-skyview/outputs
   ```

4. Ensure outbound internet access so the instance can reach NASA SkyView and PyPI.

### 2. Configure GitHub secrets

Populate these secrets so `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` can transfer the code and execute the deployment script:

| Secret | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EC2_HOST` | Public DNS name or IP of the EC2 instance. |
| `EC2_USER` | SSH username (`ubuntu`, `ec2-user`, etc.). |
| `EC2_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key (PEM contents) matching the instance key pair. |
| `EC2_INSTALL_DIR` *(optional)* | Alternate install path (defaults to `/opt/nasa-skyview`). |
| `EC2_PYTHON_BIN` *(optional)* | Explicit Python interpreter (`python3.11`, etc.). |

> AWS credentials are no longer required because the workflow connects directly over SSH.

### 3. How the pipeline deploys

1. GitHub Actions bundles `requirements.txt`, `src/`, `web/`, and `deploy/` into a tarball.
2. The tarball is uploaded to `/tmp/nasa-skyview/` on the EC2 host.
3. The remote script runs `deploy/deploy.sh`, which:
   - Copies the code into `/opt/nasa-skyview/app`.
   - Creates/updates a Python virtual environment in `/opt/nasa-skyview/venv`.
   - Installs Python dependencies with `pip`.
   - Generates a fresh `/etc/systemd/system/nasa-skyview.service` tailored to the install paths (listening on port 80).
   - Restarts the `nasa-skyview` service.

Logs are written to `/var/log/nasa-skyview.log` and `/var/log/nasa-skyview.err`, and cached SkyView tiles persist in `/opt/nasa-skyview/outputs`. Verify your security group allows inbound HTTP on port 80.

To roll back, re-run the workflow on an earlier commit or SSH into the instance, check out the desired commit manually inside `/opt/nasa-skyview/app`, reinstall requirements, and restart the service (`sudo systemctl restart nasa-skyview`).

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap ideas

- Package the downloader as a service with caching and rate-limit protection.
